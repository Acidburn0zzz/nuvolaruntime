<h1>@NAME@ @VERSION@</h1>
<p>
  You have installed <b>@NAME@ @VERSION@</b> Core Developer Kit. This software is based on the open source code
  from <a href="https://tiliado.eu/nuvolaplayer/">Nuvola Apps™ project</a>.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Nuvola™</b> is a runtime for semi-sandboxed web apps providing more native user experience and tighter
  integration with Linux desktop environments than usual web browsers can offer. It tries to feel and look
  like a native application as much as possible.
  Nuvola mostly specializes on music streaming web apps (e.g. Google Play Music, Spotify, Amazon Music, Deezer,
  and more), but progress is being made to support generic web apps (e.g. Google Calendar, Google Keep, etc.).
