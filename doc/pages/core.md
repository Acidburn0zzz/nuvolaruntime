guarantee.** If you would like to contribute to the core development, please waint a bit until
the API is relatively stable and a basic hacking documentation is made. Meantime, cou can follow
Nuvola Player development at Github:

 * [Diorite library](https://github.com/tiliado/diorite)
 * [Nuvola Player 3](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaplayer)

However, **development of service integrations is possible**, see
[service integrations development documentation]({filename}apps.md).
