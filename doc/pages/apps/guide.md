Date: 2014-07-22 19:41 +0200


**NOTE: This guide applies to Nuvola Player 3 that is currently in development.**

This guide describes creation of a new service integration for Nuvola Player 3 from scratch. The
goal is to write an integration script for *Test service* shipped with Nuvola Player

Prepare development environment
===============================

 1. Install Nuvola Player 3
 2. Create project directory `~/projects/nuvola-player` (or any other name, but don't forget to
    adjust paths in this guide).
    
        :::sh
        mkdir -p ~/projects/nuvola-player
     
 3. Create a copy of the test service
    
        :::sh
        cd ~/projects/nuvola-player
        cp -r /usr/share/nuvolaplayer3/web_apps/test ./test-integration
        # or
        cp -r /usr/local/share/nuvolaplayer3/web_apps/test ./test-integration
    
 4. Rename old integration files
    
        :::sh
        cd ~/projects/nuvola-player/test-integration
        mv metadata.json metadata.old.json
        mv integrate.js integrate.old.js
    
 5. Create new integration files
    
        :::sh
        cd ~/projects/nuvola-player/test-integration
        touch metadata.json integrate.js
        gedit metadata.json integrate.js >/dev/null 2>&1 &
